# Exp-1 ATM & BANKING SYSTEM

# AIM:
To draw the UML diagram for ATM and Banking System.

# SRS (Procedure):
### Step 1: Problem Identification
The main problem is the need for a fast, secure, and automated system that allows customers to perform banking transactions (like withdrawal, deposit, and fund transfer) without depending on bank staff.

### Step 2: Requirement Analysis
Identify user needs (customer, admin, staff).
Define functional requirements: login, balance check, withdrawal, deposit, transfer, PIN change.
Define non-functional requirements: speed, security, reliability, and usability.

### Step 3: System Design
• Draw UML diagrams to represent the system:
• Use Case Diagram
• Class Diagram
• Activity Diagram
• Sequence Diagram
• Communication Diagram
• Package Diagram
• Design the database with tables for Customer, Account, and Transaction.
